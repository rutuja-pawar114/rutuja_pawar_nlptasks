Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to convert light energy into chemical energy. 
This energy is stored in the form of glucose, which is used to fuel plant growth and development. 
Chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves, plays a crucial role in capturing sunlight. 
Water and carbon dioxide are essential reactants in this process. 
The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. 
This process is fundamental to life on Earth as it provides oxygen and food for many organisms. 
During the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed and used to split water molecules. 
This generates ATP and NADPH, which are energy carriers. 
The light-independent reactions use these molecules to fix carbon dioxide into glucose. 
Overall, photosynthesis sustains the energy needs of nearly all ecosystems.
